"vitest-plugin-vis": patch

Try to improve the performance of the plugin by skipping the rescale step and not checking the CRC of the image.

This should be safe because the image is generated by the browser, or it is a base64 string (not 100% sure on this), and the CRC is not used for anything.

If not performance improvement is seen, we can revert this change.
